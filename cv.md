## About me
I am passionate about frontend development. Primarily, I am self-taught in technologies related to this field. I am committed to ongoing learning and skill development.

I am eager to create dynamic, responsive, and cross-browser interfaces and applications that will be used by many people. 
My goal is to build solutions that deliver value to both businesses and end-users.

In the future, I see myself as a professional frontend developer who will contribute not only to business and user needs but also mentor aspiring specialists.
